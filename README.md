# Stranger Lights

Stranger Lights was an IoT project that ran from October 29th to November 4th. It allowed anyone to send a short message that got displayed on a alphabet board similar to that seen in popular Netflix show Stranger Things. The board was located on BU's campus, and received a lot of enthusiastic feedback.
